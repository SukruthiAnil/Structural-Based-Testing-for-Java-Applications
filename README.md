# Structural-Based-Testing-for-Java-Applications

## Overview
This project showcases **Structural-Based Testing** using **code coverage analysis** and **static code analysis** on two Java applications: 1) A vending machine simulation application that processes product selections, payments, and error handling and 2) A script designed to include common coding issues and data flow anomalies for static code analysis. The testing framework includes tools such as **JaCoCo** for measuring code coverage and **PMD** for detecting code quality issues.

## Tools Used
- **Programming Language**: Java 17
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA
- **Code Coverage Tool**: JaCoCo
- **Static Analysis Tools**: PMD, IntelliJ IDEA's Built-in Inspector

## Features
- Analyzed the Vending Machine application to validate functionalities and error handling.
- Utilized JaCoCo to achieve 100% statement coverage and 93% branch coverage.
- Performed static code analysis on StaticAnalysis.java application to identify data flow anomalies and code quality issues with PMD.
- Compared results with IntelliJ IDEAâ€™s built-in code coverage and analysis tools.
